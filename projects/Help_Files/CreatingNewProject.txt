The default project is .../Pascal++/projects/Pascal++.

This project is designed to use as an example to IDE's capabilities
and therefore cannot be edited or changed. 

In order to create your own project, please select the 
"New Project" option from he File menu.

After entering new project's name, a folder with the given name
will appear under .../Pascal++/projects/
All the necessary files for editing and creating you compiler
are already there.

The files that are automatically generated are the same
files that are used in the default project only this time they
can be edited.

User may use them as an example, starting point or delete them
and write new files instead.

IMPORTANT!!!!

Please make sure that when writing your own compiler
the output files must have the same names as the original
compiler output files (out1.txt, out2.ir... etc).
More on that in "Creating Your Own language" section.
