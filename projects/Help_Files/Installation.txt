Welcome to Pascal++ compiler installation!

This installation require a few critical prerequisite steps for the program to work 
Please read this section carefully before installing and using the IDE.

1. Prerequisite

This IDE was created and designed to work under a Windows7 32bit environment,
therefore we advice to use it on this type of environment as the VCG feature may not work
on a 64bit environment.

In order to create the compilers and generate machine code
"GCC - GNU compiler collections" is used and can be found on the CD
or in the next link:

http://gcc.gnu.org/

We strongly advice you to use the GCC folder located on the CD.

Please notice that Pascal++ available in 32 and 64 bit version.
Intall the GNU ToolChain from the right folder.


2. Setting GNU ToolChain Collection Before installation

Copy the GCC folder from the CD (or the one you downloaded from the GNU web site)
to any path on your main disk.

We recommend to place it in you main drive, for example c:\mingw64 for the 64bit version
and c:\MinGW for the 32bit version.

Please notice!!!

32bit version GNU folder is "MinGW" in the 32bit folder.
64bit version GNU folder is "mingw64" in the 64 bit folder.

3. Adding GCC to windows path variables

In order to use GCC from anywhere in windows we now need to add
it to windows environment variables.

Right mouse click on my computer and go to:
Properties->Advanced System Settings->Environment Variables

In the System Variables window (the lower one):
find variable named "Path", select in and press edit
add you GCC path to the end of the line.


for example in 64bit version: ....;C:\mingw64\bin
in 32bit version: ....;c:\MinGW\bin

please don't forget the ';' before adding the variable.
no need to use ';' after the last variable in line.

Press OK.
GCC has been added to windows environment variables.

6. Installing Notepad++
Several of this program's features are using Notepad++ editor.
Please download Notepad++ at:

http://notepad-plus-plus.org/

and install it on your main drive, for example c:\Notepad++

-----VERY IMPORTANT-----

Notepad++ must be installed in c:\ in order for Pascal++
to work

-----VERY IMPORTANT-----

5. Setting the main Pascal++ directory

Copy the main Pascal++ directory to any location on your drive.
THe recommended location is in the main drive. for example c:\Pascal++

Use The .jar file inside the main folder to launch the application
