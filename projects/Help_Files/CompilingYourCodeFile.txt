This section will explain how to generate a machine code
from your code file (*.p)

Prerequisite:

Please read "Creating New Language" section
before reading this.

If "Generate Machine Code" option is still disabled, please
start from the beginning "Creating New Language" section
and check for error messages.

The two other options in Module1 will be disabled until
"Generate Machine Code" are completed successfully.

To compile your code select "Generate Machine Code" from
"Module1" menu. 

If successfully compiled, "View Machine Code" and
"View Symbol Table" options will become available.

If not, compilation output error will be displayed.
